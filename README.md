# CS231-Cellular-Automata-Simulation-Conways-Game-of-Life
Exploring the simulation of entities on a 2D grid. The entities interact with each other to determine how they change over time.

This program simulated the Game of Life with a given grid size and density of live cells. The goal of the project was to learn about 2d arrays in Java.
